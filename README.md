Simple minimum distance path calculator




This was an assignment for my Data Structures class.

It is a simple implementation of a weighted graph concept, having vertices and edges connecting each vertex.

Dijkstra's algorithm is used, which finds the shortest distance path of all paths from one point to another point.

In this implementation, a CSV file of cities (vertices), each having a connection (edge) with a distance value,
is automatically loaded.  

The user is then presented with a graphical user interface that allows them to select a source
city and a destination city, and upon the click of a button display the shortest path from the source to the 
destination.
