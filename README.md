Simple minimum distance path calculator




This was an assignment for my Data Structures class.

It is a simple implementation of a weighted graph concept, having vertices and edges connecting each vertex.

Dijkstra's algorithm is used, which finds the shortest distance path of all paths from one point to another point.
